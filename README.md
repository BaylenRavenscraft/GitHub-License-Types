"There are many open source licenses to choose from, and each has its own set of terms and conditions that determine how the software can be used, distributed, and modified. Here is a brief overview of each of the licenses you listed:

None: If you don't select a license for your repository, then the default copyright laws apply. This means that others are generally not allowed to use, distribute, or modify your code without your permission.

Apache License 2.0: This is a permissive license that allows users to use, distribute, and modify the software as long as they credit the original copyright holders and reproduce the license in any copies of the software.

GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL): This is a copyleft license that requires users to distribute any modifications to the software under the same license. This means that if someone modifies the software and distributes the modified version, they must make the source code available to others under the GPL.

MIT License: This is a permissive license that allows users to use, distribute, and modify the software as long as they credit the original copyright holders.

BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License: This is a permissive license that allows users to use, distribute, and modify the software as long as they credit the original copyright holders and reproduce the license in any copies of the software.

BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License: This is a permissive license that allows users to use, distribute, and modify the software as long as they credit the original copyright holders, do not use the names of the copyright holders to endorse or promote products derived from the software, and reproduce the license in any copies of the software.

Boost Software License 1.0: This is a permissive license that allows users to use, distribute, and modify the software as long as they credit the original copyright holders and reproduce the license in any copies of the software.

This means that if someone modifies the software and distributes the modified version, they must make the source code available to others under the GPL.

GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 (LGPL): This is a copyleft license that is similar to the GPL, but it allows users to link the software with other proprietary software.

Mozilla Public License 2.0: This is a permissive license that allows users to use, distribute, and modify the software as long as they credit the original copyright holders and reproduce the license in any copies of the software.
